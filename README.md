# AmericanImmigration

## Introduction

This is a data visualization project, build on the Processing. Its theme is to focus on the status of American immigration during the period from 1860 to 2018.

The dataset we use is the number of American immigrants per year from 1850 to 2018. We hope that viewers can intuitively understand the number of immigrants in the United States each
year in the past, which countries these immigrants came from, and the reasons for the large numbers of immigrants. We think this dataset is significant on the political and social level.

## How it look

The project's visual effect is that when people immigrated to the United States, the corresponding nationality location on the map will light up with color, and a line with the same
color will be extended to connect to the United States. There will be people’s patterns running through the line. The movement of people’s patterns depends on the number of immigrants in
the country in that year. The top ten countries with the largest number of immigrants will be displayed at the bottom of the interface for us to check. We use three datasets which are 3 immigration trends (1860-1920, 1920-2000, 2000-2018), and we explain the reasons for these
three immigration trends through pictures. We chose a rhythmical background music to highlight this visualization project, because this project presents a phased migration data process
through the data set. So, using this kind of rhythmic music can resonate with the audience and highlight how the overall data on immigration has changed over time.
A data set is a combination of data, and our work is that the data set is graphically presented or analyzed. Such a realization method can enable users to better understand the content represented by the data set. Data visualization is a useful technique for visualizing abstract data
from an artistic perspective.


## Something I want to metion
We think the data visualization is a science of displaying information and an art form that can be called data art. For centuries, many mathematicians have seen beauty and symmetry in mathematical equations. The mathematics can be beautiful, and the diagrams that accompany the results can be beautiful. This is where information design comes in.
